# Vue Calculator

A calculator built in Vue.

This is one of several calculators I've built to learn different JavaScript frameworks.
- React Calculator: https://github.com/RussellShire/react-calculator
- Svelte Calculator: https://github.com/RussellShire/svelte-calculator

## Specification
Required functionality:

- Addition

- Subtraction

- Division

- Multiplication

- Percentage

- AC (All clear, i.e., reset)

- CE/C (Clear entry, i.e., the value currently inputted)

- 9 digit max

- +/- toggle

Additionally: The application should be mobile-first, but usable on any device. Your implementation of the design should be responsive, making full use of the display area available. Above an appropriate screen width (e.g. 768px), you should show a scientific calculator layout (the additional buttons donâ€™t need to actually function!)
